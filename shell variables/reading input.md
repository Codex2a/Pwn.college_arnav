**Flag:** `pwn.college{YuhXUYPsICK16KXKK51EMvHrGx0.QX4cTN0wyNzEzNzEzW}`

```bash
Connected!
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the first PWN variable properly, but you seem to not have used
'read' to do it. Please set it using 'read'
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$ read PWN
COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{YuhXUYPsICK16KXKK51EMvHrGx0.QX4cTN0wyNzEzNzEzW}
```

## Incorrect tangents I went on
tried to assign college to pwn and then read..rather than reading input

## What I learnt
how to read input....read the value while being inputted

## References 
none
